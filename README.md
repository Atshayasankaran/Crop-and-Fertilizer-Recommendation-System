# Crop-and-Fertilizer-Recommendation-System
Crop growth is heavily regulated by soil nutrients (potassium, phosphorus, and nitrogen). Certain crops yield more when the soil has a specific npk value. This model is used to determine which crops yield the most in our soil based on soil parameters, and it also recommends organic fertilizer to improve soil quality.
