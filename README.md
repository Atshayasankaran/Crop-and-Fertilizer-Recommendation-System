# Crop-and-Fertilizer-Recommendation-System
Agriculture is essential for human survival, and soil nutrients play a critical role in crop growth. Key nutrients such as Potassium (K), Phosphorus (P), and Nitrogen (N) are crucial in determining soil quality. The yield of specific crops is higher when the soil contains the right balance of these nutrients. However, the optimal crop-to-soil nutrient relationship is often unknown. Machine learning can be applied to identify which crops thrive best in given soil conditions based on soil parameters. Additionally, this model will recommend organic fertilizers to enhance soil quality. By providing recommendations for suitable crops and fertilizers, farmers can improve crop yield effectively.

# Datasets
Two datasets are used in this work.
1) Crop_recommendation.csv - This dataset includes values for Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), temperature, humidity, and pH, along with the corresponding crop.
2) Fertilizer.csv - This dataset contains various organic fertilizers and their associated N, P, and K values.
